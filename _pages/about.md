Ahad Chaudhry, originally from Pakistan, was driven by his observations of extreme poverty to pursue education as a means of making a difference. He earned a 100% scholarship for his A-Levels and was accepted into Simon Fraser University (SFU) for engineering, later switching to computing science due to his passion for programming. At SFU, a Data Science course sparked his interest in data, analytics, and machine learning, leading to a role at Environment Canada. There, he developed web applications, data ingestion scripts, and machine learning models that significantly improved team operations. While part-time at Environment Canada, Ahad interned at Activision, contributing to a real-time data pipeline for games like Call of Duty, gaining exposure to distributed systems and cloud computing technologies such as Kafka. He then joined Microsoft as a Software Engineer.

At Microsoft, Ahad has been instrumental in personalizing Viva Insights for millions of users across products like Outlook and Teams. His work includes implementing novel Differential Privacy algorithms, improving engagement metrics by up to 4x with machine learning models, and optimizing cloud resources through workflow streamlining. His data pipelines and analyses have provided critical insights into user behavior, leading to product enhancements. His most recent project involves a collaboration with Microsoft Research to apply state-of-the-art algorithms for causal insights in Copilot Analytics at Microsoft's scale. Ahad is committed to making a global impact and helping others achieve their goals. He is dedicated to continuous self-improvement and is open to connecting for guidance or collaboration.
